# Metroid Planets Modding Tools
 For quick import & export into json Worlds, Rooms, Saves and maybe more!

## Installation
1. You'll need to [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). I'm currently working with  
  version `3.10`, but if you have version `3.7` or later, it should  
	work just fine **(NOT TESTED)**.
2. Download the latest release in the right sidebar
3. Unzip the folder wherever you want (doesn't need to be in  
  the same folder as your worlds)
## Instructions
1. Go into the `modules` folder
2. Run either world2json, room2json, save2json, json2world,  
	json2room or json2save, depending on your needs. (for  
	now they will be individual scripts, but I plan to eventually  
	have a main script with preferences and such)
3. Drag & drop the file you want to convert (must match the  
	selected script!).
4. Follow the instructions until the `Press Enter to`  
  `continue...` prompt shows up.
