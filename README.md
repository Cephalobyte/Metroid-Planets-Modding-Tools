# Metroid Planets Modding Tools
 For quick import & export into json Worlds, Rooms, Saves and maybe more!

## Installation
1. You'll need to [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). I'm currently working with  
  version `3.10`, but if you have version `3.7` or later, it should  
	work just fine **(NOT TESTED)**.
2. in [Command Prompt](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+open+command+prompt) (cmd/powershell), type :  
  `py -m pip install prompt_toolkit`  
	to install the module allowing the autocompletion features.
3. Download the latest release in the right sidebar
4. Unzip the folder wherever you want (doesn't need to be in  
  the same folder as your worlds)
## Instructions
1. Run main.py
2. Select the which converter you want to use
3. Drag & drop the file you want to convert (must match the  
	selected script!).
3. Follow the instructions until the  
  `Press Enter to continue...` prompt shows up.
